DISCO
* The constructor should initialize the root node.
* We have three components for each traversal (recursing left, printing the cargo,
  recursing right). What differs is the order in which they're called.
* It would be more fitting to have System.out.print than System.out.println since
  we would prefer the nodes stated on a single line.
* Compare the cargo when inserting to decide if there is a leftward or rightward
  traversal.

QCC
* We noticed that there is no stated protection type for methods in the TreeNode
  file. We assume that the default is public.
* Thanks for the informative comments on top of each method! Very helpful.
* Trace, trace, trace!

With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

    a perfect binary tree has __2h-1__ nodes
    at each level, a perfect binary tree has __2__ nodes
    height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is __0__
