HW105 -- 'Tis Hard to Search for 'Processing'
2022-05-24t
time spent: 00.5 hrs

WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS:
- How to draw cool shapes using geometry and a coordinate plane (it make heart)
- How to use the arc function (which is different from, say, line because it is an extension of ellipse() so specifying the angle will cut part of the ellipse off)
- How to change the background color using RGB
(we also learned that we run the .exe file from the downloaded folder instead of the command on our home computers)

WHY YOU CARE:
- Easier to make things move with processing and will lead into animations or drawing with shapes
- Changing background makes things look better
