 * class GuessNumber -- fun fun fun!
 *
 * SKELETON
 *
 * eg, sample interaction with end user:
 *
 * Guess a # fr 1-100: 50
 * Too high
 * Guess a # fr 1-49: 25
 * Too low
 * Guess a # fr 26-49: 38
 * Correct! It took 3 guesses

/***
    DISCO:
    - break can be used to exit a loop.
    - return can bring you back to the start of the function call.
    - To pick a random integer in a range, you can use Math.random() and multiply it by the size of the range, then add the minimum.

    QCC:
    - When is it good to use return or break in a method?
    - Is it preferable to do this recursively or interatively?
