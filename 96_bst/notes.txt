HW96 -- BSTs is the Perfect Place for Shade / adding the methods for searching,
        height, and leaves

time spent: 1 hrs

DISCO
* When considering measuring height, we can ask the parent to ask its child how
  high up the tree it is and then add 1.
* It is not necessary for the child to know its parent.
* Counters... "think recursively."
* We must print the new methods in the main method. Additionally,

QCC
* Is there a way to write the methods without the inclusion of helpers?
