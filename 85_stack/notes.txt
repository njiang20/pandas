DISCO:
* In class, we all thought that the ArrayList implementation of a Stack would be easier,
  but because of the methods in LinkedList such as .getLast() and .addLast() .removeLast(),
  we had a much easier time implementing a LinkedList stack.
* It doesn't matter what the parameter of a general type is called, but we went with PANCAKE.
* Upon instantiation of a new ArrayList or LinkedList in the main method, we must use type String,
  not type PANCAKE, but if we were to use a different type it would work as long as we pushed elements
  of that type.
* Using the interface as a checklist makes coding a lot easier.

QCC
* What will we be using the ArrayList and LinkedList implementation of Stack for?
* Is there any benefit in using one implementation over another?
