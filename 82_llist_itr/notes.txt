DISCO:
  * You can have classes inside of classes
  * A static nested class is called a static nested class, while a non-static nested
    class is called an inner class

QCC:
  * Why do we use the variable _okToRemove?
  * In line 233 of LList.java:
    System.out.println( "...and now 2nd item is: " + james.set(1,"got") );
  * Why does it say the second item is a when we just set it to got?
  * When would you use a static nested class instead of a non-static one?
