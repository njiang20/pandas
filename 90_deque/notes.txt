HW90-- Swabbing the Deque
2022-04-12w
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCO:
* Many of the methods for Deque have the same names as the methods in LinkedList
* The methods for LinkedList are passed through Deque

QCC:
* When do we need to use Deque? Why would you use it over normal Queue?
* How would we implement the offer(), pop(), and removeLastOccurrence() methods?
* Does pop() make a new stack representation of the Deque and then pop it?
