HW90-- Swabbing the Deque
2022-04-12w
time spent: 1.0 hrs

### PLAN:
* addFirst(), addLast()
* peekFirst(), peekLast()
* removeFirst(), removeLast()
* isEmpty()
* size()

We import LinkedList and use its methods to implement adding and removing for Deque. Similar to what we did in the homework last night for ALQueue and LLQueue.
