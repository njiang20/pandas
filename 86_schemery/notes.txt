time spent: 1.5 hrs

DISCO:
* What is "at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions.outOfBounds(Preconditions.java:64):" mean?
We traced through the code, and could not find out why the index exception occurred
* The method .split is part of the Java Standard Library. We did not import anything to use it.

QCC:
* How are we supposed to implement the subtraction for the unload method?
