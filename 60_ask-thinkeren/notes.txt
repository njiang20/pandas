DISCO:
* Halving the deck and splitting up the work among several turtles is a more efficient way of sorting.

QCC:
* What happens if a turtle has three cards on hand? Or any odd number?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
* Turtles will continuously split the deck and pass it to another turtle, who will do the same, until there is only one card at hand. Then the turtle will return the card in their hand to the turtle who had passed it to them, who then in turn sorts the cards they have in their hand and also passes it to the previous holder. All the cards will be returned to the original holder in a sorted fashion.
