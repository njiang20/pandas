DISCO:
- We got a NullPointerException error when we compiled, and we realized that we need to initialize _frequency as a new ArrayList in the constructor in order for it to work.
- Our histogram sometimes printed the number of stars + 1 due to a rounding error if the max of _frequency isn't divisible by longestBar.

QCC:
- How can we rework the histogram() method so we can account for the rounding errors?
