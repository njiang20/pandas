L07: But These Go Up To Eleven
2022-03-19
Time Spent: 2.0h

DISCO:
- Object oriented programming is useful, especially when dealing with something
  as intricate as Elevens.
- It's important to compile after each small change instead of many so there are
  less errors to fix and we know what to fix.
- It gets a little confusing when there are multiple classes and we want to access
  an element of a List or Array.

QCC:
- Perfect shuffling or selection shuffling, efficiency wise?
- What does a deprecation warning mean? How may we resolve this?
  "Some input files use or override a deprecated API."
  "Warning: [deprecation] Integer(int) in Integer has been deprecated."
