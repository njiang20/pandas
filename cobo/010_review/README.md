## Lab description
**What is this code for?**
Review takes in a sentence or a review from a text file to determine its total sentiment value. From there, a star rating from 1 to 4 can be determined from the positivity or negativity of a review with starRating(). The sentences in the text files may be altered to print out a sentence with a opposite meaning in fakeReview(), or one with a stronger positivity or negativity in fakeReviewStronger() by extracting a random positive or negative adjective from positiveAdjectives.txt and negativeAdjectives.txt depending on the current sentiment value of the sentence. fakeStarRating() does a similar job but with the rating of a review (1-4).
