 * A program to carry on conversations with a human user.

 *       Uses indexOf to find strings
 * </li><li>
 * 		    Handles responding to simple words and phrases

 * This version uses a nested if to handle default responses.

 DISCO:
 * When more than one keyword is inputed, the keyword that appears in an early if statement runs first, and its response is prioritized.
 * If a keyword appears in a word, it still counts as a keyword and will run the appropriate response.
