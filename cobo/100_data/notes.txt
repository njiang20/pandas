DISCO
- We learned how to import a .csv file to sort through the data
- A . refers to the current directory
- We don't have to use all of the provided parameters in an XML or CSV, we can choose which ones we want
- Use -f to add a file that is usually left out because of the .gitignore


QCC
- Why isn't there something like sinbad,jar built into Java?
- Is using Java really the best way to take in and process data?
- Is there a way to tell Java to add the first n parameters of a CSV instead of typing the name of each one individually?
- Why is sinbad.jar so big that it can't be opened in GitHub?


Fried Chicken's CSV FLOW:
- We found a csv containing data for movies on http://www.kaggle.com
- To find the names of the parameters to put into our ArrayList, we looked at the first line of the file


TRUBZ
- We didn't know how to compile Welcome01.java at first (learned from the provided readme and Piazza)
- We didn't know how to "link" the data, since it was a local file (we put in the local path instead)
- When fetching, we got errors for no class found, which we fixed by first putting in the type of ArrayList in "" as a parameter before our regular parameters
