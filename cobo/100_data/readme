Our experience:
 * sinbad.jar is a great tool to sort through large data sets and filter to find what you want
 * Sorting through data is easy when we know what each "column" contains
 * When handling many parameters for data, it is tedious to put in each individual one

data sets:

To make a JAR available to runtime environment (JRE)...

```
$ javac -classpath .:sinbad.jar -d . Driver.java
$ java -classpath.:sinbad.jar Driver
```
