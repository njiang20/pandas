// HW65 -- How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...

DISCO:
- We can use solveH() recursively by adding a queen, and if it worked, then we incremented the number of columns by one, and called solveH() on that.
- We needed if(col == _board.length) for solveH() to work recursively.
- The solution board will always be the same for n.

QCC:
- Thinking about the problem recursively helped us find solutions.

Hypothesis:
While n >= 5, there will always be at least one solution for an n x n board.
