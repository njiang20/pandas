HW97 -- Prune Your Tree / adding remove method
2022-05-12r
time spent: 1 hrs


DISCO
* Three possible cases for removal: no children, one child, two children.
* If starting left of the root, keep going right. If starting right of the root,
  keep going left.
* We can continue removing recursively if the new parent node has children.
* A toString() method is helpful.

QCC
* Does remove need a helper function to work?
* How would we implement the pointer to the parent?
